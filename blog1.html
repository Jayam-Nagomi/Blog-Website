      <p>"Something is better than Nothing!"</p>
      <p>
        In this article, I share about my first real world project experience in
        the data field. I chose an interesting topic to do my project which is a
        problem statement given in SIH Hackathon which is building a model to
        efficiently handle the water demand.
      </p>
      <h4>Finding the model & Features</h4>
      <p>
        I did my research and chose LSTM to be my model to forecast water
        demand. Interestingly, First I looked upon some projects built using
        this model such as stock forecasting then learned the architecture to
        better understand the LSTM. And it worked.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I went to build the project. As every student does, I went to
        ChatGPT because I had no idea where to start and found that I should
        collect three important types of data that describe water availability:
        reservoir levels, rainfall rates, and historical data on water usage.
      </p>
      <h4>Data Collection</h4>
      <p>
        Then started collecting the daily data of reservoir level and rainfall
        level (year: 2023) from data.gov.in and for water usage the daily data
        of water usage was not available so I used the yearly average data from
        data.opencity.in. This took me a 2 days to complete because most of the
        data repositories by government were not maintained well which led me to
        404 ERROR!.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I merged them all three into one csv file and started cleaning it
        by removing rows with NULL values. Then merged them using Dates and
        Districts.
      </p>
      <h4>Facing Issues</h4>
      <p>
        My data had many variables that I didn't even understand. But again I
        just copied the code from chatGPT and found the performance is poor. The
        line plot looked awful and I couldn't find what's going wrong that made
        me frustrated.
      </p>
      <img src="Images/blog1-1.png" alt="Visualization of Data" />
      <p>
        Then I took a break and came back again to find a mistake that I have
        given a feature to predict the same feature but in different metrics. So
        Once I found that I realized my first mistake that
      </p>
      <p><i>1. I am using the features which I don't even understand.</i></p>
      <p>
        So, I went to YouTube to learn more about the domain and figured out
        which variables contribute to water demand and I used them to predict.
        (But still the plot looked crazy). As soon as, I started learning about
        the domain I used some tutorials to learn and write code on my own
        rather than just copy pasting from chatGPT.
      </p>
      <img src="Images/blog1-2.png" alt="Variables Chosen" />
      <p>
        And after seeing the tutorials I found ARIMA models like LSTM need
        timely Data but
      </p>
      <p><i>2. I removed some dates which had null values.</i></p>
      <p>
        So, I revoked and started to impute the null values with monthly
        averages.
      </p>
      <img src="Images/blog1-3.png" alt="Imputing the null values" />
      <p>
        <i
          >3. And I found a problem with water usage which had yearly average.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since, I couldn't able to find any daily data of water usage on the
        internet I used the data with the wrong values to find out what would
        happen. Basically I was expecting it to do well as other two variables
        were in the right order.
      </p>
      <p><i>4. Messy Plots</i></p>
      <p>
        Still, I keep getting the messy plots. So I went to chatGPT to find what
        is going on. It said the frequency of data is high which makes the plot
        not understandable. So I resampled them to make it interpretable.
      </p>
      <img src="Images/blog1-4.png" alt="Visualization after resampling" />
      <p><i>5. Processing Time</i></p>
      <p>
        Once done, I found that the learning process was so long. I waited day
        and night but still it is a never ending story...
      </p>
      <p>
        So again, I went to watch some tutorial to find out about the Early
        Stopping condition which makes the model stops processing when it is not
        learning anymore. This way the time taken to process was reduced.
      </p>
      <p><i>6. Fine Tuning</i></p>
      <p>
        After training, I found that it needed some adjustments. That's when I
        realized that although I had learned about architecture and everything
        related to LSTM, I didn't fully understand the meaning of each
        parameter. So, I went to ChatGPT to learn about it and discovered that
        increasing the dropout value would help prevent overfitting. I then made
        the necessary changes.
      </p>
      <h4>Results</h4>

      <h4>Experience Gained</h4>
      <p>
        Overall it was a great project experience where I made mistakes,
        corrected some of them but learned a lot about my career. Moreover, I
        also experienced how a real world scenario of a data science project
        would look like. Here are the few things I learnt from my mistakes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Domain Knowledge</b> is important (to know which features to use &
          more)
        </li>
        <li>NULL values need to <b>handled</b> properly</li>
        <li>
          <b>Data Quality = Model Performance</b> (because my model didn't
          perform well on yearly average even though I fine tune the model)
        </li>
        <li>
          Knowing the working of model is not enough. We must know its
          <b>data requirements</b> ( for LSTM we needed daily data) and
          parameters ( dropout is needed to prevent the overfitting)
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, to fine tune <b>maths</b> is important especially algebra is
          needed (statistics is NOT ENOUGH)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here is the link to my Collab notebook:
        <a
          href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l26h5JBRYJVJGTUxDxJNHChWYraMZCLe?usp=sharing"
          >notebook link</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        This whole project took me about 7 days to complete as it was my first
        time I was learning about everything before implementing it. Each step I
        took came with its challenges, from data collection, cleaning, and
        merging to visualization, modeling, and fine-tuning and Each challenge
        had its own level of difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
        And most of the all the processing time was so exhausting. Since, I was
        using a government laptop (6 years old) with 4GB of RAM and low power
        processor. So, I used Collab, where I had to constantly monitor whether
        the system was running, which kept me awake for two whole nights. All
        these efforts resulted in amazing outcomes, earning appreciation and
        feedback from the jury during the presentation.
